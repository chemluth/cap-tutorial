/*
Because your file is called risk-service.js and, therefore, has the same name as your application definition file risk-service.cds,
CAP automatically treats it as a handler file for the application defined in there. CAP exposes several events and you can
easily write handlers like the above.

In this case, the event after is triggered after a READ was carried out for our Risks entity. In your custom handler, you get all
the data (in this case, all the risks) that was read according to the query. You can loop over each of them and, if needed, adjust
the data of the response. In this case, you change the value of the criticality when the impact is bigger than 100000. The new values
for criticality are then part of the response to the read request.

So, this affects the application’s response, but how does it translate into a changed UI? For this, you have got to go back to the
annotations you created in Create a CAP-Based Application where you find your srv/risks-service-ui.cds file. There, you had the
two columns prio and impact annotated with an additional Criticality annotation. This annotation points to the criticality property
of your application.
